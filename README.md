# Car-Parking-System
In these modern days finding car parking is a big issue in congested cities. There are too many vehicles on the road but not enough parking spaces. One of the biggest problems is when we enter a parking area then we realize that there are no empty parking slots to park our cars. Another biggest problem is after entering in a big parking area we confused to find the empty parking slot to park our car. Sometimes maybe we all have been facing these two problems that wasted our important time. This System helps the car’s driver to park their car with minimum wastage of time with accurate information of the availability of the space to park.  <br>
Upload the above code in Arduino. Follow the steps:<br>
1.Install Arduino IDE<br>
2.Connect your Arduino Board (Arduino Uno), use a USB cable to connect your Arduino to your computer.<br>
3.Open Arduino IDE. Create a new sketch and copy-paste the above code.<br>
4.Select the Board and Port from the dropup box<br>
Go to Tools → Board → Arduino Uno (or specific board).<br>
Go to Tools → Port and select the correct COM port.<br>
5.Click the "Upload". Now the code will be compiled and uploaded to the Arduino board.<br>
6.Check the LCD & Servo Behavior. The LCD should display parking information.<br>
The servo motor should move when IR sensors detect a car.<br>
